#** ABCforIoT - Architecture Blueprint Canvas for IoT**
_A template for realizing your IoT solutions.

##The Problem
Designing and developing an IoT solution is complex and demands a lot of initial planning. Some key scenarios that contribute to its complexity:
- 		An IoT architecture can span multiple layers like device gateways, field gateways, processing pipelines, data storage sources, analytics, machine learning and reporting. All these tiers need to work together and also ensure they work at optimum load and scale for the millions of connected devices. This requires extensive collaboration between teams within an organization. For example, the Hardware engineering team can communicate to the backend to transmit data from the device, however the data analytics team need to process and apply algorithms on the data to make it meaningful.
- 		The IoT solution may require changes or optimization to an existing process. For example, a change in an existing assembly line process of a car manufacturer. It requires collaboration and interaction with business owners of these processes and divisions. 
- 		An IoT Solution may require external parties such as device manufacturers and partners to provide part of the solution.
- 		Too many options: While IoT development is not new, however integration with newer technologies like Cloud and Machine learning requires teams to have clarity what platform or technologies they should use. 
The complexity of developing an IoT solution leads to greater challenges for the projects teams. Letâ€™s discuss some of these challenges through a set of personas:
- The Architect: The Architect is responsible for the high level design of the system. The Architects needs to ensure that all requirements and translated into technical specifications and all design constraints are identified. With the complexity of the IoT solution spanning across layers it can quickly become cumbersome for an Architect to focus on all aspects of the solution. 
- The Project Manager: The Project Manager is responsible for prioritizing user stories and product backlog items. New generation tools like storyboarding and approaches like Lean and Agile Methodology help refine and prioritize these requirements, however since IoT spans across multiple layers, prioritizing requirements across all aspects of the IoT solution can become challenging.
- The Project Team: The Project team is responsible for the actual development and delivery of the solution. The team needs to know what are the technologies and third party solutions need to be used, whether any prototyping will be required to validate user stories. 
So, how do we make sure requirements are understood by the team? Moreover, how do we engage them in conversation that lead to a solid and informed design. The IoT Architecture Blueprint attempts to solve this problem.
##What is ABCforIoT?

##Other solutions out there
Is ABforIoT a new concept?, absolutely not! There are many solution that can be used today that allow to build similar models . The difference is that ABforIoT targets Architects and Developers mainly, its a brainstorming tool that leads the team to take meaningful decision or identify gaps that need to addressed for the success of the solution. It is not affiliated to the business conversation but more focussed on how we solve the problem architecturally. In that sense, it is different from something like a Business Model Canvas, which focusses more on the business model.
