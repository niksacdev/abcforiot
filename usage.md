# How to use the templates
As described earlier, the templates come in two flavours:
+ Basic
+ Collaborative
Templates are available <a href="https://github.com/niksacdev/abcforiot/tree/master/templates" target="_blank">here</a>

Basic provide a structure for the most common elements required in an IoT solution, it can be used to architect an end-end IoT solution by entering contents to each of the components and finalizing the technology stack to be used for the architecture.
While the Basic version help provide a blue print for architecting IoT solutions, the Collaborative template goes one step beyond by provind placeholders for decision and action steps, this makes the design process interactive and can be used as a document to brainstrom design ideas.
The following screens show how to use the template as part of a design and implementation process. 

## Step 1: Ideate
The first step is brainstrom current problems, identify issues, and discover ideas.

Example:

## Step 2: Prioritize
Once all ideas have been defines, prioritize items that are important and potential issues that can hinder the design realization

## Step 3: Design and Prototype
Once priotiziation is complete, leverage existing development methodologies to continue your IoT solution development.
